# SLAP (Simultaneous Localization And Pursuit)
This repository holds the code stack for the SLAP algorithm.
In order to test the SLAP algorithm in a simulation environment with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), please refer to the [SLAP Simulation](https://github.com/dsor-isr/slap_simulation) repository.
