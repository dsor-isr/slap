# SLAP (Simultaneous Localization And Pursuit)
This repository contains the ROS code USED to generate the results in the paper entitled **Target localization and pursuit with networked robotic vehicles: theory and experiments**.
In order to test the SLAP algorithm in a simulation environment with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), please refer to the [SLAP Simulation](https://github.com/dsor-isr/slap_simulation) repository.
